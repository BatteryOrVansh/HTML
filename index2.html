    <h1> HEADING ! (h1 is heading tag inside BODY) </h1>

    <h2>this is also heading but included in h2 tag.. </h2>

    <p>DOCTYPE defines the type of document (html, xml... etc)
        <br>
        the HEAD includes the characterstics of the html file to give information to the browser
        <br>
        i am writing all of this inside the paragraph tag that's why the font is smaller than the heading
        <br>
        i am understanding all the concepts through YT video of Chai aur Code.......
        <br>
        i am seperating the lines using br tags (new line character ig)
        <br>
        <h3>Search engines identify and understand these tags to rank the websites who use tags properly</h3>
        <br>
        there is importance of every tag and that tag is responsible for the structure of the site
        hehe

    <p>the characterset can be utf 8 or utf 16...... utf 16 supports emojis
        <br>
        <h3>heirarchy</h3>
        the heirarchy is: html (parent) > head & body (children) > title, heading, paragraph (grandchildren) > so on
        <br>
        but these 3 are main
        <br>
        <h4>tags</h4>
        always close the tags which are not standalone 
        <br> standalone tags like br and Doctype one
        <br>heheheh
    </p>
